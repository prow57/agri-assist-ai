    "Maintain plant vigor by ensuring adequate fertilization and improving host vigor to reduce susceptibility to early blight.",
    "Remove volunteer weeds, including volunteer tomatoes, to reduce disease inoculum sources.",
    "Rotate crops every 2-3 years to reduce inoculum density in the field.",
    "Apply fungicides preventatively to prevent the spread of early blight.",
    "Plant tolerant varieties, such as 'Mountain Magic', 'Mountain Fresh Plus F1', 'Bush Celebrity Hybrid', 'Big Beef Hybrid', 'Celebrity Hybrid', 'Rutgers', 'Juliet F1', 'Tommy Toe', 'Old Brooks', or 'Cabernet F1'.",
    "Keep plants growing vigorously by providing fertile, rich soil and plenty of sunlight.",
    "Use compost to promote healthy plant growth and fruiting.",
    "Irrigate from below to avoid overhead systems that can exacerbate fungal growth.",
    "Mulch around plants to reduce soil splash and provide a barrier to fungus movement.",
    "Prune tomatoes to promote airflow and remove lower leaves that are in contact with the soil.",
    "Remove infected tissues early to slow the progression of the fungi and prevent further infection."
