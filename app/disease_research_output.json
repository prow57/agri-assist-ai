    "general_information": [
        "Early blight is a fungal disease that affects tomatoes, causing yellowing leaves and black spots on the leaves and stems.",
        "The disease is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and can be spread through contaminated soil, water, and insects.",
        "Early blight can be managed through the use of resistant varieties, crop rotation, and fungicides.",
        "The disease can be identified by the appearance of small, circular brown spots on the leaves, which can merge together and kill the leaf.",
        "Early blight can also affect the stem and fruit of the plant, causing dark and sunken spots."
    ],
    "recommended_treatments": [
        "Use certified seeds from a reputable company or seeds that were kept from disease-free fruits.",
        "Use resistant varieties such as 'Mountain Fresh Plus F1', 'Juliet F1', 'Tommy Toe', 'Old Brooks', or 'Cabernet F1'.",
        "Use mulch to prevent soil splash and stake the plant to keep it upright.",
        "Prune lower leaves and stems that are close to the soil surface.",
        "Grow tomatoes under a well-ventilated plastic tunnel that keeps foliage dry and relative humidity low.",
        "Use drip tape instead of sprinkler irrigation.",
        "Keep or let foliage dry during or after a rain or morning fog to minimize the level of infection.",
        "Space plants and orient rows to allow air to circulate and sunlight to penetrate.",
        "At the end of the season, remove all plant debris from the garden and burn or bury it by deep plowing."
